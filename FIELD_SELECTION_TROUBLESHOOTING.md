# Field Selection Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue Description
Field selection in the report builder is redirecting to some other page instead of selecting the field.

## Troubleshooting Steps

### Step 1: Check Browser Console
1. Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to the Console tab
3. Click on a table column/field
4. Look for any console logs or error messages

### Step 2: Expected Console Output
After the fix, you should see these console logs when clicking a field:
```
Field clicked: field_name table_name
handleFieldSelect called: {field_object} table_name  
Field with collection: {field_with_collection_object}
Field exists: true/false
Adding field / Removing field
```

### Step 3: Check for JavaScript Errors
Look for any red error messages in the console that might be causing the redirect.

### Step 4: Check Network Tab
1. Go to the Network tab in Developer Tools
2. Click on a field
3. See if any unexpected network requests are being made

### Step 5: Common Causes & Solutions

#### Cause 1: Form Submission
- **Issue**: Field button might be inside a form that's submitting
- **Solution**: Added `type="button"` and `e.preventDefault()` to prevent form submission

#### Cause 2: Event Bubbling
- **Issue**: Click event bubbling to parent elements
- **Solution**: Added `e.stopPropagation()` to prevent event bubbling

#### Cause 3: Link Elements
- **Issue**: Field might be wrapped in an `<a>` tag
- **Solution**: Check HTML structure for any anchor tags

#### Cause 4: JavaScript Errors
- **Issue**: Errors breaking the event handler
- **Solution**: Check console for error messages

#### Cause 5: React Router Navigation
- **Issue**: Programmatic navigation in event handlers
- **Solution**: Check for `navigate()` or `window.location` calls

### Step 6: Temporary Fix Applied
I've added the following debugging and fixes to your code:

1. **Sidebar.jsx**: Added event prevention and logging
2. **App.jsx**: Added detailed logging to field selection handler

### Step 7: Test the Fix
1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Open the browser console
3. Click on a table field
4. Check if the field gets selected without redirecting
5. Look at console logs to see what's happening

### Step 8: If Still Not Working
Try these additional steps:

#### Clear Browser Cache
```bash
# Clear cache or try incognito mode
```

#### Check for Service Workers
```javascript
// In browser console, check for active service workers
navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations().then(function(registrations) {
    console.log('Service Workers:', registrations);
});
```

#### Check for Browser Extensions
- Disable browser extensions temporarily
- Test in incognito/private mode

#### Check React Developer Tools
- Install React Developer Tools
- Check component state changes

### Step 9: Manual Testing
1. Open the sidebar
2. Expand a table collection
3. Click on a field name
4. Field should:
   - Get highlighted (background color change)
   - Appear in the selected fields list
   - NOT navigate to another page

### Step 10: Reporting Results
Please test and let me know:
1. What console logs you see
2. Whether the redirect still happens
3. Any error messages
4. What page it redirects to (if still happening)

## Quick Test Commands
```bash
# Start the frontend
cd client
npm run dev

# Check if backend is needed
cd ../server  
node server.js
```

## Expected Behavior
- Click on field â†’ Field gets selected/deselected
- No page navigation should occur
- Field should appear in Canvas component
- Background color should change to indicate selection
